# SpecTr: Spectral Transformer for Hyperspectral Pathology Image Segmentation
This repository contains PyTorch models for SpecTr (Spectral Transformer).

SpecTr is a hybrid transformer backbone that can be easily applied to other hyperspectral images.

how can do data preprocessing


When we talk about data, we usually think of some large datasets with a huge number of rows and columns. While that is a likely scenario, it is not always the case — data could be in so many different forms: Structured Tables, Images, Audio files, Videos, etc..
Machines don’t understand free text, image, or video data as it is, they understand 1s and 0s. So it probably won’t be good enough if we put on a slideshow of all our images and expect our machine learning model to get trained just by that!
